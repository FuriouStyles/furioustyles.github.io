This is my first test blog post using Pelican. This will be the first step in creating an awesome portfolio website filled with my super cool projects I've done at home and with Lambda School.

This is a new paragraph, and I want to see how it shows up in the published website. In addition to including raw markup files like this test blog, I'm going to be including Medium posts and embedded Jupyter notebooks to change up the content style of my site!
