Summary: This is my assignment submission for Sprint 2, Module 3 - Making Explanatory Visualizations. I was able to get some pretty neat things done here, and I'm excited to keep growing my skills with matplotlib, seaborn, and bokeh! Also, I'm trying to update my GH pages account without a page build error, so this is a good test.
