It's been a month since I started at Lambda School, and we're well established in our rhythm. I still have a few rhythmatic adjustments to make in order to keep up with the material going forward. The current spring is focused on and aptly titled Statistical Tests and Experiments, and so far it's proving to be a doozy! That's ok, because I'm able to follow along for now. I've never been very good with statistics generally, having never studied it in school, and it shows how underprepared I am for it. Supplemental study will definitely help me to maintain the high scores I've earned so far.

The really great news for me personally is that I have been able to integrate Lambda School into my life with minimal disturbances to my regular schedule. I go to bed a bit later, but I'm still able to take care of my kiddos, handle things at the house, and get my training workouts in while still being on point for LS. One sacrifice I have had to make is that I can't spend as much time with my wife at night during the week as I was previously able to. It sucks, but she is at least able to get some additional sleep and we make sure to spend a lot of quality time on the weekends.

I need to get back to posting regularly, so with this post I'm going to start building a template to review my sprints and modules to make it easier for me to keep you all updated, and to make it easier for you all to follow along! Be on the lookout for a few blog posts from me about my first two Sprints at Lambda School!

I've also started a couple of projects on GitHub that I'm pretty excited about. In the larger s of scope of Full Stack Development and Data Science, these are pretty insignificant things to be excited about. First, and most important, is that I've started building my own Pelican theme. This portfolio site is built using the Pelican site generator, and the selection of themes for it is lacking to say the least. I'm excited to contribute to an open source project, which would be a first for me, and create something truly unique that is totally and completely my own.

Before I jet and start writing about these Sprints, I also wanted to share something super awesome about Lambda School. I don't know if this is on purpose, but in addition to all of the content available to me for the Data Science course, I also have access to all the data from all of the other courses as well. Specifically, this means I have access to the Full Stack Web Development courses, which will give me additional leverage over other possible data science candidates. What's more, all of the videos for all of the lectures area available on both in the Training Kit and on YouTube!

One of my projects this weekend is to build a schedule that now includes the Full Stack Web Development course into my workload, my projects, and Codecademy practice. I've got a jam packed few months ahead of me, including the Sugar Bert National Championships in Kissimmee that I'm training for.
